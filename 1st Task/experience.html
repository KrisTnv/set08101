        <h1>My Experience Page</h1> 

        <p>I am a second year networking student pursuing a career in the programming and networking aspect of the IT field. 
		My skills vary from interacting with numerous operating systems and programming languages to building and designing my own 
		network within a company office and presenting my work in front of the whole department. I have developed most of my skills 
		through the CISCO networking course which I have numerous certificates from and the other part of my skills I have developed 
		through hard work and my own research. I am looking for a role within an organisation that is going to help me develop my 
		current skills and expand them into something greater that is going to help me further my career and build my future.
